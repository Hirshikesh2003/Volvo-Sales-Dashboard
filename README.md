# Screen shot of the Dashboard

Below is the image of the Dashboard, it is carefully created with the Volvo cars sales data from 2011 to 2018.

The dataset's contents were less, but this Dashboard brings the most out of it and gives a brief idea about their cars and sales throughout the years.

# Sales over the years

The below visualization gives us an overall idea of the sales performance of the cars over the years, as the first 4 visualizations have all the years from 2011 to 2018, and the sales of the model over the years. There's a filter applied to the model name, so the user can visualize the particular model he needs for the particular year.

And the user can also use this feature to compare between models.

# Comparison between the models

This is a bubble chart with the model names and the size determines the number of sales, the bigger the size, the more the number of sales. The filter is applied to the model names, so the user can have a quick check on the models he wants to compare.

 # Sales percentage

 Finally, we have a pie chart with the sales percentage of the models over the years from 2011 to 2018. A filter is applied to the sales percentage, so the user can use the slider to visualize between particular percentages.
